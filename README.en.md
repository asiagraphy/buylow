# buylow

![buylow dashboard overview](screenshots/overview.png)

**A personal toolkit to build Korean-equity (KOSPI·KOSDAQ) automated trading strategies without code, backtest them on historical data, and run them live.**

Built on the [QuantConnect LEAN](https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean) engine, where **the same strategy definition runs unchanged in both backtest and live trading**. All data and API keys stay on your own machine.

## Overview

buylow handles Korean-equity automated trading through a **local web dashboard** that runs only on your PC. After installing, you use it **through the browser dashboard**.

- Define strategies with **signal combination rules + risk settings** — no coding.
- Backtest against **whole-market Korean data** and review results as a Korean-language summary plus a trade log.
- Run the same strategy live on **Korea Investment & Securities (KIS) or Toss Securities** (backtest = live isomorphism).
- All data and API keys are stored locally only and are never sent anywhere.

## Features

### Signals (alpha) — 7 of them

Each signal judges, per ticker per trading day, whether conditions are **buy-favorable / sell-favorable / neutral**. Parameters are tuned on the Strategy tab.

| Signal | Type | Description | Key parameters |
|---|---|---|---|
| EMA | Trend | Buy-favorable when the short MA is above the long MA, sell-favorable when below | Short / long periods |
| MACD | Trend·Momentum | Buy-favorable when the MACD line is above the signal line | Fast / slow / signal |
| RSI | Overbought·Mean-reversion | Buy-favorable when oversold, sell-favorable when overbought | Period / oversold / overbought |
| Momentum | Trend | Buy-favorable when the last N-day return is positive | Lookback period |
| Bollinger Bands | Mean-reversion·Breakout | Mean-reversion on band touch; switches to trend-following on a strong breakout | Period / std multiplier / switch threshold (%) |
| Value | Fundamental | Buy-favorable when low PER·low PBR and ROE (= PBR/PER) is above a floor (avoids value traps) | PER·PBR caps / ROE / dividend floor |
| Flow (supply-demand) | Korea-specific | Buy-favorable when the recent N-day cumulative net buying by foreigners/institutions/individuals (selectable) is positive | Cumulative days / investor selection |

Value and flow signals require fundamental and flow data to be loaded (see *Data management* below).

### Buy rules

Signals are combined into a boolean rule. Conditions within a group must all hold (**AND**), and groups are OR'd together (**OR**), to trigger a buy. You also set a **signal-hold period** (how many extra days to hold after the buy signal disappears). Only one strategy is stored (single strategy).

You build the concrete rule on the **Strategy tab of the dashboard** (condition-group builder) — see [Dashboard](#dashboard) below.

### Risk management

The strategy decides buys; sells are decided by signal changes and the risk rules below (leave a field blank to disable it).

- **Per-security stop-loss (%)** — sell when the price drops N% from the buy price
- **Per-security take-profit (%)** — sell when unrealized gain reaches N%
- **Trailing stop (%)** — sell when the price drops N% from the post-buy high
- **Long-only (no shorting)** and a **concurrent-holdings cap** (when exceeded, hold only the most liquid names) apply by default.

### Execution timing (two-layer design)

The strategy runs in two layers, and **the same code executes identically in backtest and live**.

- **① Selection** — picks buy/sell candidates **once a day, always from the previous day's close** (no intraday re-selection → prevents overtrading).
- **② Execution timing** — decides only *when* to fill those candidates. The chosen timing automatically determines the data resolution.

| Timing | Resolution | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Open | Daily | Fill at the **open** of the next trading day |
| Close | Daily | Fill at the **close** (MarketOnClose) of the next trading day |
| Time-of-day | Minute | Fill the full quantity at a specified time |
| TWAP | Minute | Split the regular session (390 min) into N slices and fill the quantity across them (reduces market impact) |
| Pullback | Minute | Enter on a dip from a reference price / exit on a rebound |

- **Risk is also evaluated once a day at the close** (same philosophy as selection). Per-minute stop-losses were dropped because intraday noise caused overtrading; the close handles the liquidation *decision*, while the timing above handles the *fill*.
- Tickers/days without minute data **fall back to the open automatically**.
- ⚠️ Due to a LEAN data-feed limit, minute backtests are accurate only up to a scale of **tickers × trading days ≲ 10,000** (blocked beforehand if exceeded). Daily and live are unaffected.

### Backtest

- Period selection (date picker + quick buttons for 1 week / 1 month / 3 months / 6 months / 1 year); initial capital fixed at ₩100M.
- Universe: search by name/code, bulk-add an index (KOSPI200·KOSDAQ150), all tickers, or your own index (groups).
- Background execution + progress/logs, run history retained (SQLite, per-row/bulk delete).
- Results = a Korean-language summary (total return, final equity, max drawdown, win rate, Sharpe, etc.) + a trade log (date, ticker, buy/sell, quantity, amount, reason). Large trade logs (tens of thousands of rows) are shown with pagination.

### Data management

All data is managed on the **Data tab of the dashboard**.

- One **Update data** click incrementally loads price (OHLCV), flow (net buying by investor type), and fundamentals (PER/PBR) for all tickers (5-year backfill when empty).
- **Auto-load scheduler** (on by default) — incrementally loads daily bars on a fixed interval while the server runs. If you designate minute-bar targets, it loads those too.
- **Minute loading** — pick tickers/indexes and store minute bars (already-loaded days are skipped) via the active broker's API (KIS keeps minute bars for **about 1 year at most**; Toss uses getCandles).
- **Load status** — search by name/code, filter by index, view per-ticker detail (price·flow).
- **My index (custom ticker group)** — group tickers you want on the Groups tab, then use them across backtest / minute loading / load status with one click as `★name`, just like KOSPI200.

### Live trading (KIS · Toss)

- Turn on automated trading on the **Trade tab** and it places real orders using your saved strategy + target tickers (turn it off to stop). KIS and Toss share the same screen and the same strategy code.
- Buys follow the strategy and timing; exits follow signals/risk — the same code as backtest.
- **Account monitoring** — deposit / buyable amount / holdings (buy price / current price / P&L), market-open/close status, trade history (KIS uses execution inquiry, Toss uses buylow's own trade log; auto-refreshed every 10 seconds).
- **Today's selection** — previews which tickers would be bought/sold based on the saved strategy, target tickers, and current holdings (reproduces the once-a-day previous-close selection exactly).
- Automated trading is **off** by default; once on, it places orders immediately per the saved strategy. For the full live procedure see [docs/LIVE_KIS.md](./docs/LIVE_KIS.md) (KIS) · [docs/LIVE_TOSS.md](./docs/LIVE_TOSS.md) (Toss).
- **Operational resilience** — while automated trading is on, it resumes automatically if the server restarts (deploy/reboot), and if the live process exits unexpectedly it is restarted automatically after a short backoff. When orders bunch up (e.g., at the open), submissions are paced to the broker's per-second order limit and transient errors are retried, so a single order's failure never halts the whole bot.
- ⚠️ **Live requires building the broker adapter DLL once** (the Docker install bakes it into the image automatically; a native install makes it optional since it isn't needed for backtest). If you flip the toggle without building it, you'll see a *"live adapter is missing"* notice — run the adapter-build step in [Setup](#setup) above (`scripts/build-adapter.sh` builds both the KIS and Toss adapters).

## Supported brokers

| Broker | Account/balance inquiry | Live trading | Status |
|---|:---:|:---:|---|
| **Korea Investment & Securities (KIS live)** | ✅ | ✅ | Working |
| **Korea Investment & Securities (KIS paper)** | ✅ | ✅ (paper server) | Working — recommended for pre-live validation |
| **Toss Securities** | ✅ | ✅ | Working — real-only (no paper); validate on a real account |

- Pick a broker on the Settings tab and enter its keys; inquiry and live orders then run through that broker.
- KIS keeps **live and paper app keys/accounts fully separate**, so each is registered and managed independently (same logic, different environment).
- **Toss Securities** has no paper server (real only); enter just the OAuth2 keys (Client ID/Secret) and the account is resolved automatically (no account number / HTS ID). Lacking a fill-notification WebSocket, the adapter confirms fills by **polling orders**.
- Trading (balance·orders) and **minute-bar loading run through the chosen broker's API** (KIS = 120 bars/call, ~1y retention; Toss = getCandles, 200 bars/call). **Daily historical data comes from the auth-free pykrx** (broker-independent).

## Architecture and pipeline

An always-on **orchestrator** receives your requests (backtest·live) and **runs the strategy engine per job**, managing it. All processing and data happen on your PC, and the same strategy flows identically through backtest and live.

    User([User]) -->|browser| Dash[Local dashboard]

**Core design**

- **Write a strategy once and it applies identically to backtest and live** (isomorphism).
- Selection (what to buy/sell that day) runs once a day on the previous day's data; execution follows the chosen timing — two separated layers.
- The strategy decides buys; signal changes and risk decide sells.
- All data, settings, and history are stored only on the user's PC.

## Setup

### Install

There are two ways to install — **Docker** (simplest, any OS) or a **native install** (Linux · macOS).
Both give you backtest and live in one go. **Windows users should use Docker** (a native install means
matching the .NET/Python runtimes by hand per OS, which is fiddly).

<details open>
<summary><b>① Docker (recommended — any OS)</b></summary>

You only need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (.NET, Python, and LEAN are all baked into the image).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JeongSeongMok/buylow.git
cd buylow

# Build + start in the background (the first build takes a few minutes to fetch the .NET SDK + NuGet)
docker compose up -d --build
# To use a different port:  BUYLOW_PORT=9000 docker compose up -d --build

# Logs / stop
docker compose logs -f
docker compose down
```

- Data, results, and settings live in host directories (`data/`, `runs/`, `state/`), so they **persist even if
  you delete the container** — settings (`config.local.yaml`), run history (`buylow.db`), and the KIS token live in `state/`.
- API keys are entered in the dashboard's **Settings** tab and stored in `state/config.local.yaml`.
- The dashboard is mapped only to the host's `127.0.0.1`, so it is **local-only** (no external network exposure).
- The broker adapter DLLs (KIS·Toss) for live trading are included in the image.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>② Native install (Linux · macOS)</b></summary>

You need **.NET 10 SDK** (runs the engine), **Python 3.11** (runs strategies), **uv** (Python env), and **git**.

```bash
# 1) .NET 10 SDK (add the export to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc to make it permanent)
curl -fsSL https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh | bash -s -- --channel 10.0 --install-dir "$HOME/.dotnet"
export DOTNET_ROOT="$HOME/.dotnet" && export PATH="$HOME/.dotnet:$PATH"

# 2) Install uv (git must be installed separately)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# 3) Code + dependencies
git clone https://github.com/JeongSeongMok/buylow.git
cd buylow
uv python install 3.11
uv sync --locked

# 4) Run the dashboard (default port 8420)
uv run --locked python -m orchestrator.api
# To use a different port: BUYLOW_DASHBOARD_PORT=9000 uv run --locked python -m orchestrator.api

# 5) (For live trading — skip if you only backtest) Build the broker adapters (KIS·Toss)
uv run --locked python -m orchestrator.lean --prepare    # check Python and build the launcher (no orders)
scripts/build-adapter.sh                                  # build KIS·Toss adapters + copy DLLs next to the launcher
                                                          #   (one only: scripts/build-adapter.sh toss)
```

</details>

After launching, open the dashboard in your browser (default `http://127.0.0.1:8420`, or the port you set above).

`pyproject.toml`, `.python-version`, and `uv.lock` define Python 3.11 and the Python dependencies.
The orchestrator and LEAN strategies share the uv project environment; manual activation is unnecessary.
Run tests with `uv run --locked pytest`; omit development dependencies with `uv sync --locked --no-dev`.
To load a `.env` file, explicitly pass `--env-file .env` to `uv run`.
Use `uvx` for isolated standalone tools and `uv run` for this project's application and tests.

### Key setup

Keys are entered and managed on the **Settings tab of the dashboard** (stored locally only).

- **KRX ID·password** — for flow·fundamental data ([free signup](https://data.krx.co.kr)). Not needed if you use price only.
- **Broker keys** — on the Settings tab, choose the broker and enter its keys.
  - **KIS (live/paper)**: App Key·App Secret·account number·HTS ID (separate for live/paper; the HTS ID is needed for live fill notifications).
  - **Toss Securities**: just Client ID·Client Secret (account and fills are automatic; no HTS ID).

The authors are not liable for any financial loss. When using it, you must comply with your broker's API terms and all applicable laws and regulations. Backtest results are estimates based on historical data and do not guarantee future returns. In particular, live automated trading sends real orders the instant you flip the toggle, so be sure to validate thoroughly on a paper account and start with a small amount.
